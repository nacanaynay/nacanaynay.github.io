	<h1>My Opinions on the New Fortnite Season</h1>
	<p id="fortnite">I actually don't mind the new Fortnite season. I am not a fan of the Combat Kit, but mostly because I want to find it every time I play because I think it's the strongest melee weapon. I prefer a melee weapon, though, that still puts some range between me and my opponent, which is why I liked the Typhoon Blade from last season. The baseball bat in this new season is not as strong as the new Combat Kit, and I also don't like the bat pushes your opponent away. I supppose, though, that's the whole point in making the game more competitive.</p>
